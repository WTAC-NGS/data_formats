    "## Base quality\n",
    "[Illumina sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumina_dye_sequencing) technology relies on sequencing by synthesis. One of the most common problems with this is __dephasing__. For each sequencing cycle, there is a possibility that the replication machinery slips and either incorporates more than one nucleotide or perhaps misses to incorporate one at all. The more cycles that are run (i.e. the longer the read length gets), the greater the accumulation of these types of errors gets. This leads to a heterogeneous population in the cluster, and a decreased signal purity, which in turn reduces the precision of the base calling. The figure below shows an example of this."

    "During library preparation, __mixed clusters__ can occur if multiple templates get co-located. These clusters should be removed from the downstream analysis. \n",
    "__Boundary effects__ occur due to optical effects when the intensity is uneven across each tile, resulting in higher intensity found toward the center. \n",
    "__Cross-talk__ occurs because the emission frequency spectra for each of the four base dyes partly overlap, creating uncertainty. \n",

    "Aligning reads to a high-quality reference genome can provide insight to the quality of a sequencing run by showing you the mismatches to the reference sequence. This can help you detect cycle-specific errors. Mismatches can occur due to two main causes, sequencing errors and differences between your sample and the reference genome, which is important to bear in mind when interpreting mismatch graphs. The figures below show an example of a good run (top) and a bad one (bottom). In the first figure, the distribution of the number of mismatches is even between the cycles, which is what we would expect from a good run. However, in the second figure, two cycles stand out with a lot of mismatches compared to the other cycles."
