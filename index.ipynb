    "# NGS Data formats and QC\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "There are several file formats for storing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. In this tutolial we will look at some of the most common formats for storing NGS reads and variant data. We will cover the following formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "__FASTQ__ - This format stores unaligned read sequences with base qualities  \n",
    "__SAM/BAM__ - This format stores unaligned or aligned reads (text and binary formats)  \n",
    "__CRAM__ - This format is similar to BAM but has better compression than BAM  \n",
    "__VCF/BCF__ - Flexible variant call format for storing SNPs, indels, structural variations (text and binary formats)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, we will work through some examples of converting beween the different formats.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Further to understanding the differenet fie formats, it is important to remember that all sequencing platforms have technical limitations that can introduce biases in your sequencing data. Because of this it is very important to check the quality of the data before starting any analysis, whether you are planning to use something you have sequenced yourself or publicly available data. In the latter part of this tutorial we wil describe how to perform a QC assessment for your NGS data, and also suggest how to identify possible contamination.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "On completion of the tutorial, you can expect to be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe the different NGS data formats available (FASTQ, SAM/BAM, CRAM, VCF/BCF)\n",
    "* Perform conversions between the different data formats\n",
    "* Perform a QC assessment of high throughput sequence data\n",
    "* Identify possible contamination in high throughput sequence data\n",

    "## Tutorial sections\n",
    "This tutorial comprises the following sections:\n",
    "1. [Data formats](formats.ipynb)\n",
    "2. [File conversion](conversion.ipynb)\n",
    "3. [QC assessment](assessment.ipynb)\n",
    "4. [Identifying contamination](contamination.ipynb)\n",

    "## Authors\n",
    "This tutorial was written by [Sara Sjunnebo](https://github.com/ssjunnebo) based on material from [Petr Danecek](https://github.com/pd3) and [Thomas Keane](https://github.com/tk2).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the commands from this tutorial\n",
    "You can run the commands in this tutorial either directly from the Jupyter notebook (if using Jupyter), or by typing the commands in your terminal window. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Running commands on Jupyter\n",
    "If you are using Jupyter, command cells (like the one below) can be run by selecting the cell and clicking _Cell -> Run_ from the menu above or using _ctrl Enter_ to run the command. Let's give this a try by printing our working directory using the _pwd_ command and listing the files within it. Run the commands in the two cells below."
